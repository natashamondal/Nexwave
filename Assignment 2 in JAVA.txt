Question 1. Create a class called account with the data members(Accno-integer, name-string, phone_no-integer,balance_amt-float) and following methods:
            a) getinput() to get input from the user
            b) Deposit() method which takes the amount to be deposited in to his/her account and do the calculation.
            c) Withdraw() method which gets the amount to be withdrawn from to his/her account and do the calculation.
            Print the appropriate results.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Account {
  int acc_no;
  String name;
  long phone_no;
  float balance_amt;
  int amt1;
  int amt2;

void getinput() {
	System.out.println("Enter Name, Account no, Phone no, Balance:");
	Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
	name=sc.next();
	acc_no=sc.nextInt();
	phone_no=sc.nextLong();
	balance_amt=sc.nextInt();
	System.out.println("Account no: "+acc_no+" Name: "+name+" Phone No: "+phone_no+" Balance: "+balance_amt);
		
}
void deposit() {
	System.out.println("Enter the amount to deposit: ");
	Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
	amt1=sc.nextInt();
	balance_amt=balance_amt+amt1;
	System.out.println("Money deposited successfully. Your available balance is "+balance_amt);
	
}
void withdraw() {
	System.out.println("Enter the amount to withdraw: ");
	Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
	amt2=sc.nextInt();
	balance_amt=balance_amt-amt2;
	System.out.println("Money withdrawn successfully. Your available balance is "+balance_amt);
}
public static void main(String args[]) {
	Account A=new Account();
	A.getinput();
	A.deposit();
	A.withdraw();
}
}


Output:
Enter Name, Account no, Phone no, Balance:
John 101 1239123471 500
Account no: 101 Name: John Phone No: 1239123471 Balance: 500.0
Enter the amount to deposit: 
500
Money deposited successfully. Your available balance is 1000.0
Enter the amount to withdraw: 
1000
Money withdrawn successfully. Your available balance is 0.0



Question 2.a) Create a class to hold information about books. Write a function to display information about the book.
             Data members : Title, Author, Cost, no_of_books
           b) Create 3 instances of the above class and initialize the members of the class with the data accepted from the user.
           c) Accept a title and the no_of_books required from the user. Find whether the book exists. If exists, check if the no_of_books are sufficient and if so indicate the total cost of the books.

import java.util.Scanner;

class Book {
	String title;
	String author;
	double cost;
	int no_of_books;

	public Book(String title, String author, double cost, int no_of_books) {
		this.title = title;
		this.author = author;
		this.cost = cost;
		this.no_of_books = no_of_books;
	}

	void display() {
		System.out.println("Title: " + title + ", Author: " + author);
		System.out.println("Cost: " + cost);
	}
}

public class Books {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter data for books.");
		Book x[] = new Book[3];
		
		for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
			System.out.print("Enter title: ");
			String title = sc.next();
			System.out.print("Enter author: ");
			String author = sc.next();
			System.out.print("Enter cost: ");
			double cost = sc.nextDouble();
			System.out.print("Enter no of books: ");
			int no_of_books = sc.nextInt();
			x[i] = new Book(title, author, cost, no_of_books);
		}

		System.out.print("\nEnter title to search: ");
		String title = sc.next();
		System.out.print("Enter no of books required: ");
		int no_of_books = sc.nextInt();

		boolean found = false;
		for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
			if (title.equals(x[i].title) && (no_of_books <= x[i].no_of_books)) {
				found = true;
				x[i].display();
				System.out.println("Books are sufficient.");
				System.out.println("Total cost of books: " + (x[i].cost * no_of_books));
			}
		}

		if (found == false) {
			System.out.println("No books found.");
		}
	}
}

Output:

Enter data for books.
Enter title: Hello
Enter author:  World
Enter cost:  10
Enter no of books:  5
Enter title: Hi
Enter author:  Jane
Enter cost:  50
Enter no of books: 2
Enter title:  Nobody
Enter author:  John
Enter cost:  100
Enter no of books:  5

Enter title to search: Nobody
Enter no of books required:  3
Title: Nobody, Author: John
Cost: 100.0
Books are sufficient.
Total cost of books: 300.0
